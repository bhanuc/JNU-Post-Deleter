##JNU-Deleter

This extention was made in frustation of seeing so many facebook posts talking about JNU. Getting so many such is extremely overwelming but is affecting my studies. 

Ample of time, and Mid-Sem Frustation- Here goes a extention that hides all the facebook posts that have the word JNU in them.

You can download the extention from the output folder and just drag the downloaded crx into the extention page.
